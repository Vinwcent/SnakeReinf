# SnakeReinf

## Introduction

Small pure reinforcement (No deep learning) playground I made for a lecture I gave at the University of Washington.

The objective is to give intuition about reinforcement learning to beginners by letting them play with hyperparameters.

## Installation

You just need 3 packages,
```
pip install gymnasium pygame tqdm
```

## Additional ressources

This code was part of a workshop at the AI Institute in Dynamics Systems
