# SnakeReinf

Small pure reinforcement (No deep learning) playground I made for a lecture I gave at the University of Washington.

You just need to modify the hyperparameters of the snake agent in the ```launch.py``` file and see how it behaves.
The goal of the students was to find a set of hyperparameters that win (fill the whole grid with the snake body) everytime in less than 1 000 000 training episodes.
